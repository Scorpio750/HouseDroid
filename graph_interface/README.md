Graph data structure built for the Housedroid

The graph will be used to allow the robot to map the area for itself.
Vertices will be created to store locations where the robot needs to make a decision regarding which direction to go next.
Edges will contain the degree and magnitude of its respective vertex.

Graph is capable of running Dijkstra's algorithm.
