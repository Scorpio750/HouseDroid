Speech to Text
==============

Current Author: Patrick Wu

This portion of the project is meant toward trying to
convert speech to text, with the ultimate goal of using it
to issue verbal commands to HouseDroid.

Currently working on trying to get PocketSphinx working
so that we can analyze speech and convert into text. It's
a pain in the butt.
